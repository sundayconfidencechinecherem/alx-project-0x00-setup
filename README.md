# ALX Project 0x00 - Next.js Setup

## Objective
This project demonstrates the essence of creating a project using CLI tools like `npx` coupled with `create-next-app`. The goal is to understand different approaches to scaffold a Next.js project and become familiar with the setup options.

## Project Creation Approaches

### Approach 1: Interactive Setup
Using the command `npx create-next-app@latest` without options provides multiple prompts to help set up the initial project interactively.

### Approach 2: Pre-configured Options
Being familiar with the options ahead of creating the project allows for a faster, non-interactive setup. This is the approach used for this project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Start Visual Studio Code** and open a new terminal via `Terminal -> New Terminal`

2. **Navigate to your project directory**

3. **Run the creation command:**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest alx-project-0x00 --typescript
